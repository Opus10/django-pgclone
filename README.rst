django-pgclone
##############

``django-pgclone`` makes it easy to dump and restore Postgres databases.
Here are some key features:

1. Streaming dumps and restores to configurable storage backends like S3.
   Instances with limited memory aren't a problem for large databases.

2. A restoration process that works behind the scenes, swapping in
   the restored database when finished.

3. Configurable hooks into the dump and restore process, for example,
   migrating a restored database before it is swapped.

4. Reversible restores, making it possible to quickly revert to the initial
   restore or the previous database.

5. Re-usable configurations for instrumenting different types of dumps and restores.

Quickstart
==========

To dump a database, do::

    python manage.py pgclone dump

To list database dump keys, do::

    python manage.py pgclone ls

To restore a datase, do::

    python manage.py pgclone restore <dump_key>

Database dumps are relative to the storage location, which defaults to
the local file system. Dump keys are in
the format of ``<instance>/<database>/<config>/<timestamp>.dump``.

When listing, use an optional prefix. Restoring
supports the same interface, using the latest key that matches the
prefix.
